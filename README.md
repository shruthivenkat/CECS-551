### MIDTERM PROJECT : 

#### Problem statement 

The dataset has five independent failure modes TWF, HDF, PWF, OSF, and RNF. If one of the five mode fails, then the process fails, and the machine is marked as failed. However, the end user or administrator is never aware of the feature which lead to failure of the process. The task is to design a model which address explainability for the failure. 

(1) Design a decision tree based explainable model and provide an explanatory interface 
(2) Compute the fairness of the model  
(3) Perform a what-if analysis using CeterisParibus on the given dataset
