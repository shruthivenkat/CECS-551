### MIDTERM PROJECT : 

#### Problem statement 

The dataset has five independent failure modes TWF, HDF, PWF, OSF, and RNF. If one of the five mode fails, then the process fails, and the machine is marked as failed. However, the end user or administrator is never aware of the feature which lead to failure of the process. The task is to design a model which address explainability for the failure. 

(1) Design a decision tree based explainable model and provide an explanatory interface

(2) Compute the fairness of the model  

(3) Perform a what-if analysis using CeterisParibus on the given dataset

### FINAL PROJECT : 

The dataset represents the unit sales (in number/quantity) of various products sold in the USA, organized in the form of grouped time series. More specifically, the dataset involves the unit sales of around 3000 products, classified in 3 product categories (Hobbies, Foods, and Household), and 7 product departments in which the above-mentioned categories are disaggregated. 

The products are sold across 10 stores, located in 3 States (CA, TX, and WI). In this respect, the most disaggregated data, i.e., product- store unit sales, can be grouped based on either location (store and state) or product-related information (department and category).

1. Use Tableau to visualize the dataset_02.
